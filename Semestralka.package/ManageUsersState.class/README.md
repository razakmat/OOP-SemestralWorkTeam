I'm a state class for deleting existing users. I'm available only for AdminUsers. 

An admin user can delete selected user using my butttonDelete. The admin cannot delete himself from database (he can't even see his nickname in the list).
An admin can also change a role of selected user, always switches form NormalUser to AdminUser and vice versa.
