I am a state where user ends up when he invokes a MovieDatabaseError (an exception). 

I remember an instance of error which brought a user here, and display it's message. I also remeber a state from which user got here so he can return where he was.

My methods:
* errorReceived return an instance of error which was thrown and brought user here - see MovieDatabaseErrors class for more info.
