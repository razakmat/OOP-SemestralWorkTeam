I am a state where user ends up when he invokes a MovieDatabaseError (exception). 

I remember an instance of error which brought a user here.

I also remeber a state from which user got here so he can return where he was.

My methods:
* errorReceived return a class side variable - an instance of error which was thrown and brought user here
