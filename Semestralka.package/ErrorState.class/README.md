I am a state where a user ends up when he invokes a MovieDatabaseError (an exception). 

I remember an instance of error which brought the user here, and display its message. I also remeber a state from which the user got here so he can return where he was.

My methods:
* errorReceived - returns an instance of error which was thrown and brought the user here - see FilmDatabaseErrors class for more info.
